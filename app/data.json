        "Last year, I did a surfing instructor course, and I spent the summer teaching people to surf. It was great! I was in the sea and sun all day, and every evening, my friends and I had a barbecue on the beach. I don’t want to stay in the UK. It’s too cold here! I want to fly to Greece or Egypt. I’ll go there alone. I’m sure I will meet lots of cool people there!",

        "Thus, the next time you find yourself sharing a simple “Good morning” or a small talk about the weather with someone you don’t know well, think of it as tending to your garden of possibilities. Every person we meet, no matter how briefly, adds a thread to the intricate tapestry of our social lives. And every thread, regardless of its thickness, contributes to the strength and beauty of the whole.",
        "Compared to traditional gambling, cryptocurrency trading is seen as socially acceptable. It’s something that smart but adventurous people do.
